## On NLP

* NLP involves using  textual content/data 
* How a computer deals with textual content/data
* How to deal with text data

## Processing

* How a computer processes input data
* 

## Examples of NLP Problems

### Sentiment Analysis

* Opinion Mining
* 

### Topic Modeling

* 
* [...]
* 

### Text Generation

* 
* 
* 


## Data Mining and Warehousing Workflow

* Loosely falls under analytics
    * Using data to make decisions
    * Programming, Mathematics & Statistics and Communication
* 

### Programming

* scikit-learn, nltk [optional], pandas, re, TextBlob, gensim
* 

### Mathematics and Statistics
* 
* corpus, document-term matrics
* sentiment analysis, topic modeling and text generation
* 

### Communication

* Problem formulation
* Visualisation
* Domain knowledge
* 



### Data Mining Workflow

1. Formulate Questions
2. Collect, Clean and Normalise Input Data
3. Perform an initial Exploratory Data Analysis exercise
4. Apply apppropriate technique
    * Linear regression
    * Classification algorithms
5. Share Insights



## Data Cleaning and Pre-processing Illustration

1. Formulate Question
    * Clear and Measurable
    * 

2. Data Collection
    * Input: question
    * Output: Pre-processed data
    * 
    * Where to get data
    * How much data
