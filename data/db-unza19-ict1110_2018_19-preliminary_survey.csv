With CCSE and DCSE we learnt about the different types of computer systems, their uses and applications, we also learnt the basics of CPU design, management of information systems and how to develop solutions to everyday problems that come up, and programming and entrepreneurial skills. With Android Mobile Application Development I learnt how to develop applications for the Android operating system be it for mobile devices, wear devices or Television using the Java programming language.

The courses I took under CCSE are Engineering Mathematics, Engineering Science, Digital Electronics, Information Technology and Application Packages (Theory and Practical), Computer Hardware Maintenance and Repair (Theory and Practical), Computer Networks and Communications (Theory and Practical), Communication Skills and Foundation for Management. The courses I took under DCSE are Digital Electronics II, Computer Hardware Maintenance and Repair II, Computer Networks and Communications II, Management Information Systems, Entrepreneurship, Programming and Database Technology (Theory and Project (project is still pending submission, hopefully it will be done this year and submitted either this year or next year)) and Operating Systems.
